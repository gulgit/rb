Learning R programming (#rstats)
========================================================
What is R?
-------------------------
According to the R-FAQs, [R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files.](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html)

The terms statistical, computation and graphics may convey that R is not a language for everyone to learn. Even those familiar with programming languages may prefer to chose Python, as it opens up opportunities in the areas other than data analysis and statistical computing. 

Few of the reasons that motivated my friends to learn R are
* Job market for R programming is hot.
* R is perceived as good launching pad to switch to the booming fields of 'big data' and data analytics.

Though these two reasons look convincing to learn R, I beg to differ because
* R programming is very easy to learn. Anyone with or without exposure to a programming language can master it in a short span of time. The emphasis on adopting 'R' by industry is unprecedented, and the academics and training institutions will soon flood the market with a lot of R programmers. In near future, the jobs on R programming will not be as lucarative as today.
* R has a variety of packages that can be applied in several data analytic problems. To exploit the power of 'R', one has to know how to apply these statistical and machine learning alogrithms. This requires good understanding of probability, statistics and the related concepts. If you are looking at getting into data analytics and bigdata, learning R programming is very important but may only serve half the purpose.

Not withstanding my commentary on learning R, I request you to explore more on the subject. Some of the useful links are
* [Why you should learn R first for data science](http://www.sharpsightlabs.com/learn-r-data-science/)
* [A must read interview of Dr. Hadley Wickham](https://peadarcoyle.wordpress.com/2015/08/02/interview-with-a-data-scientist-hadley-wickham/)
* [How to learn R as a programming language?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1744861/how-to-learn-r-as-a-programming-language)
* [What are some good books, web resources, and projects for learning R?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/420296/what-are-some-good-books-web-resources-and-projects-for-learning-r?lq=1)


Learning R
-------------------------
EdX offers two self paced courses to learn R and statistics. Request to enroll and finish the course. 
* [Data Analysis for Life Sciences 1: Statistics and R](https://www.edx.org/course/data-analysis-life-sciences-1-statistics-harvardx-ph525-1x)
* [Explore Statistics with R](https://www.edx.org/course/explore-statistics-r-kix-kiexplorx-0)

Ample online resources are available on internet to help you clarify any doubts. Once you are done through this course, I recommend you to read this book, [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham.

This sets a good foundation for to evolve into a good user of R.

What do I use R for?
-------------------------
Let me confess that I love programming in Python than in R. The reasons that pulled me towards R are
* Availability of wide range of packages to play with data (dplyr), visualise (ggplot2 & ggvis), and analyse (using statistical & machine learning techniques) that simplify my work.
* The features of Rmarkdown that facilitates reproducable research and simplified the process of sharing the code, results and data with others, and writing reports.
* Integration with several external systems that helps in transferring the data to R environment and viceversa.

**I am agnostic to sticking only to one programming language and preferring one over the other. It is important to recognise that one has to be flexible to use any of the open source tools available. I also use Python frequently.**
